# Crowdfunding prototype
Video demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZDLGS86wAs
This is a prototype to my first App project. The goal here was to exercise and test my learning skills to a fullstack project.
It's a React App, with Node Express backend and MongoDB. 

Here a Creator user can create an Event project that he wants to get a funding. And the supporters users can find from the DB the projects created using a search engine with some filters as locality, date, title, etc...

This is a prototype in developing stage, so it's still missing  many features that I should implement in the future as athentification, user roles, checkout operation..., and also work in a prettier frontend, (Right now is just for the basic funcionality)
